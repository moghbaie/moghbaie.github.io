title: "About me"
---

I am a highly motivated Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for building large-scale, distributed machine learning algorithms and systems. Throughout my career, I've leveraged expertise in deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) and strong programming skills (Python, R) to develop and deploy impactful models in production environments.

My experience spans various domains, including drug discovery research at Johnson & Johnson, where I performed large-scale genome-wide analysis and implemented machine learning to identify genetic associations with complex diseases. I'm also well-versed in bioinformatics, having designed data processing pipelines for proteomics and genomics at Rockefeller University. My academic background is equally diverse, with a PhD in Systems Engineering and Software Development from Stevens Institute of Technology and an ongoing Artificial Intelligence certificate program at Columbia University.

Currently, I'm particularly interested in applying my skills to the field of drug discovery, but I'm always eager to explore new challenges and contribute to cutting-edge projects.
